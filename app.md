Restaurant App Using Qwik and Firebase
Overview
This project is a restaurant web app built with the Qwik framework for ultra-fast loading and Firebase for real-time database and authentication. The app allows restaurant owners to manage their menu dynamically via a UI connected to Firebase.



Features:
Menu Display: Categories like appetizers, main courses, desserts, and drinks with detailed descriptions, prices, and images.
Online Reservations: A reservation system where customers can book tables directly from the site.
Online Ordering: For delivery or pickup, including integration with payment systems.
Customer Reviews: Display reviews and ratings from previous customers.
Contact Information & Location: Including an interactive map, address, and contact form.
Special Offers & Events: Highlighting special deals or upcoming events.



Need to have: 
Firebase UI: Build a UI where restaurant owners can add, update, or remove items. For the customer-facing part, you can fetch the menu from Firebase and display it in real-time.
Firebase Authentication: Use Firebase Authentication to ensure only authorized users (restaurant owners) can modify the menu.

UI for Restaurant Owners:
Admin Panel: A secure admin panel where restaurant owners can log in and manage menu items (create, edit, delete).
Real-Time Updates: Use Firestore's real-time features so that updates to the menu are immediately reflected on the website.

Creating a well-structured, maintainable app is crucial for future scalability and ease of development. When working with Qwik and Firebase, it's essential to organize your codebase in a way that separates concerns, promotes reusability, and simplifies the process of adding new features or modifying existing ones. Here’s a proposed structure you can use for your restaurant app:

1. Folder Structure
Here’s a recommended folder structure for your Qwik + Firebase app:


restaurant-app/
├── public/                    # Public assets (images, icons, etc.)
├── src/                       # Source code for your app
│   ├── components/            # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── Menu.tsx           # Menu component (displays menu items)
│   │   ├── MenuManager.tsx    # Admin component (menu CRUD operations)
│   │   └── Navbar.tsx         # Navigation bar
│   ├── hooks/                 # Custom hooks for logic separation
│   │   ├── useAuth.ts         # Authentication hook
│   │   └── useFirestore.ts    # Firestore interaction hook
│   ├── pages/                 # Different pages of the app
│   │   ├── index.tsx          # Homepage
│   │   ├── menu.tsx           # Menu page for customers
│   │   └── admin.tsx          # Admin dashboard page for restaurant owners
│   ├── services/              # Firebase services and business logic
│   │   ├── firebaseConfig.ts  # Firebase setup
│   │   └── menuService.ts     # Menu management (CRUD operations)
│   ├── styles/                # Global and component-specific styles
│   ├── utils/                 # Utility functions
│   ├── App.tsx                # Root component
│   ├── routes.tsx             # Application routes
│   └── index.tsx              # Entry point of the app
├── firebase.json              # Firebase configuration for hosting
├── package.json               # Dependencies and scripts
├── tailwind.config.js         # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── README.md                  # Documentation
2. Key Directories and Files
1. Components Directory (src/components/)
This directory holds all the UI components, each responsible for rendering parts of the user interface.
Example:
Menu.tsx: Displays the restaurant's menu.
MenuManager.tsx: Allows restaurant owners to add, update, or delete menu items.
Each component should be simple and focused on UI concerns.
2. Pages Directory (src/pages/)
Contains the main application pages, like the homepage (index.tsx), the menu page for customers (menu.tsx), and the admin dashboard (admin.tsx).
Each page should combine components into a meaningful layout and may contain page-specific logic.
3. Hooks Directory (src/hooks/)
Custom hooks to manage application logic, like Firebase authentication and Firestore operations. This makes the logic reusable and isolated from components.
Example:
useAuth.ts: Handles authentication state, login, and logout logic.
useFirestore.ts: Provides CRUD functions for Firestore operations, like fetching menu items.
4. Services Directory (src/services/)
This directory abstracts Firebase-specific logic, like database queries or authentication processes, into reusable services. This helps decouple Firebase logic from UI components.
Example:
menuService.ts: Handles the Firestore interaction for adding, updating, and deleting menu items.
firebaseConfig.ts: Contains Firebase initialization and configuration.
5. Utilities Directory (src/utils/)
Contains utility functions that might be reused throughout the app. Things like formatting prices, handling dates, or converting data structures go here.
6. Styles Directory (src/styles/)
Contains global styles and Tailwind configuration.
Organize styles based on whether they are global or specific to components.
7. Routes (src/routes.tsx)
Manages application routes using Qwik's router. Pages like /menu and /admin are mapped to the relevant components.
This centralizes the routing logic, making it easier to manage as the app grows.
