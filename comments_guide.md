Here are guidelines for writing comments in JSDoc style, ensuring consistency and clarity across your codebase:

JSDoc Comment Guidelines
General Structure

Begin each comment block with /** and end with */.
Start with a brief description of the function’s purpose on the first line.
Use additional lines for notes, parameters, returns, and any other relevant information.
Function Description

First Line: Write a concise summary of what the function does.
Notes: If applicable, add a note about any important considerations, such as performance tips or library recommendations.
Parameter Documentation

Use the @param tag for each parameter:
Format: @param {type} name - Description.
Type: Indicate the data type (e.g., string, number, boolean, Array, Object).
Name: Use the exact name of the parameter as it appears in the function signature.
Description: Provide a clear explanation of what the parameter represents and its purpose.
Return Value Documentation

Use the @returns tag to describe what the function returns:
Format: @returns {type} Description.
Type: Specify the data type of the return value.
Description: Clearly explain what the returned value represents.
Example Usage (Optional)

If relevant, consider including a small code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. Use the @example tag for this:
Format: @example // Code snippet here.
Consistency

Use the same formatting and terminology throughout your comments to maintain a consistent style across the codebase.
Clarity

Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary. Aim for comments that are accessible to all engineers, regardless of their experience level.
Updates

Update comments whenever the code changes to ensure they remain accurate and relevant. Comments should be a reflection of the current state of the code.
Example Comment Block
Here’s a template that follows the guidelines:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * functionName - Briefly describes what the function does.
 * 
 * Note: Any additional context or important information can go here.
 *
 * @param {type} paramName - Description of the parameter.
 * @returns {type} - Description of the return value.
 * @example
 * // Example of how to use the function
 * const result = functionName(paramValue);
 */
const functionName = (paramName) => {
  // Function implementation
};
